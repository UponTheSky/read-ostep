# Paging: Introduction
- **segmentation**: chop things up into *variable-sized* pieces
- **paging**: chop up space into *fixed-sized* pieces
  - each piece(fixed-sized unit) is called a **page**
  - so the physical memory is an array of fixed-sized slots called **page frame**s
  - each frame can contain a single virtual-memory page

- so "page" is a concept in virtual memory, whereas "page frame" is the corresponding concept in pyhsical memory
